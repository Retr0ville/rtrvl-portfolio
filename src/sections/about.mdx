> I am a self motivated Fullstack Software developer. I am a highly research driven engineer and as such I have knowledge in wide range of programming environments and I can easily adjust to fill whatever role may be required of me , from centering a div on the Frontend to setting up email automations on the backend and even up to containerization with Docker and managing AWS deployments.

I have experience working at an enterprise level and remotely as well. I am fully confident in my skills as a software developer.

In  my freetime I may be found scrolling through stack-overflow, dev.to, 'tech-Quora' and 'tech-Youtube'. I like being a 'fly on the wall' of discussions regarding software development, while contributing where I can, this lets me discover a lot of information and learn new things.
